# Embedded Programming on NexysA7 FPGA Board with Vivado

This repository serves as a showcase of my practices and projects in embedded programming using Vivado on the NexysA7 FPGA board. It demonstrates my proficiency in developing digital systems, implementing Verilog designs, and analyzing waveforms for verification and debugging purposes.

## Folder Structure
- /src: Contains Verilog source files for various projects and exercises.
- /waveforms: Holds waveform files captured during simulation for analysis.
- /docs: Additional documentation, schematics, or notes related to the projects.
- /tools: Any additional tools or scripts used in the development process. </br>

## Projects
- lab1: Implement alu, 1bitsub and 4bit adder files. Learn to execute through master.xdc.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project files in Vivado IDE.
3. Explore the Verilog source files in the /src directory.
4. Load waveform files from the /waveforms directory for analysis.
5. Refer to documentation in the /docs folder for additional insights.
